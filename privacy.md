# Privacy Policy

Effective date: January 12, 2026

All Rewards is a simple, on-device rewards wallet. We do not collect, store, or share personal data on our servers. The app only requests the information it needs to show the right card when you are near a store.

## Information We Collect
- **Location (while using the app):** Used to detect nearby stores and surface the relevant reward card. Location data is not stored or sent to any server.
- **Card images you add:** Stored locally on your device so you can view your cards. These images are not uploaded or shared.
- **No accounts or analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics, ads, or tracking SDKs.

## How We Use Information
- To show the closest store and display the matching reward card while the app is open.
- To keep your card images available on your device for your use only.

## Data Storage and Retention
- Location data is transient and only used in real time while the app is open.
- Card images remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app.

## Sharing and Disclosure
- We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
- We do **not** transmit your location or card images to any server.

## Permissions
- **Location (While Using the App):** To detect nearby stores and show the right card. You can disable this in your device settings; the app will still work but cannot auto-detect stores.
- **Photos/Media (Read):** To let you pick card images. Images stay on your device.

## Security
We rely on your device's security features and store data locally. No method of storage is 100% secure, but we use only the minimum permissions needed.

## Children
The app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Your Choices
- Disable location permission to stop location use.
- Delete card images from within the app or uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect app changes. Material updates will be reflected by a new effective date.
